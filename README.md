Craigslist for NYUAD

Installation
------------

Setup a virtual environment with all the required modules.

The sqlite database must also be created before the application can run, and the `db_create.py` script takes care of that.

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
